There are so many social networks I use that I decided to try to make use of some of the data stored there. 

The places I managed to get data from:
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/queue/list/)
* [aTimeLogger application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aloggers.atimeloggerapp)
* [goodreads.com](http://goodreads.com/)
* [csfd.cz](https://www.csfd.cz/)
* [zatrolene-hry.cz](http://www.zatrolene-hry.cz/)

The places I failed to get data from:
* [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/)
* [GoG](https://www.gog.com/)

My scripts are certainly quite crude, but they manage to get the job done. I want to list the possible pitfalls and lessons from my experience on this [here](lessons.md).

I plan on writing also a less technical account on medium.

You can find a uselessly long todo list of the tasks [here](yearReview_todo.md).
